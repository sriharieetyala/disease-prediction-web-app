# disease-prediction-web-app
I built this web app using Streamlit to help people get an early idea of what disease they might be dealing with based on their symptoms. The app takes user inputs, processes them using a trained machine learning model, and then gives predictions about potential diseases. It also pulls in real-time data from OpenAPI, so the information is always relevant and up to date.

Technologies:

Backend: Python, Scikit-learn (for making disease predictions)

Frontend: Streamlit (for the clean, easy-to-navigate interface)

API: OpenAPI (for pulling in real-time disease data)
